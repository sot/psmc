---++ Version 8.6.0

This version is primarily an update to the model calibration coefficients in
order to reduce the size of underpredictions for forward-sun 1-CCD
observations.  Along with this is some code cleanup, documentation
updates, and improvement in the calibration code and procedure.  Version
control was migrated from subversion to mercurial.

---+++ characteristics.py
   * Update calibration based on a simplex fit of all parameters (except
     u01quad) using 1pdeaat and 1pin1at data for 200 days before 2010:001.  This
     starts just after the FA6 heater turn-off.  
   * The updated calibration reduces the underpredictions occurring in
     forward-sun low-power observations.  It also backs out the ad-hoc offset
     of 1.7 that was applied to account for the FA6 turn-off since now there
     is enough data to fully re-calibrate all the parameters.
  
---+++ psmc_check.py
   * Remove the explicit time=Now default from run_start_time and use the 
     DateTime(None) == Now behavior.
   * When run_start_time is supplied as a cmd line option then write a pickle
     data file 'validation_data.pkl' with telemetry and predictions.

---+++ psmc_calibrate.py
   * Update to use standalone sherpa 4.2 + matplotlib.
   * Add command line option to specify number of cores for multiprocessing.
     Default value of 0 implies single processor operation.
   * Use simplex fitting.

---+++ Other
   * Updated the code and/or calibration update procedure.
   * Added new script plot_resid_comparison.py to compare residuals for the 
     new vs. old characteristics.
   * Changed versioning to use a psmc_check.py code version, characteristics.py
     version, and a minor version for non-controlled elements.

---+++ Testing
   * Ran new psmc_check.py using the _current_ release characteristics.py and
     compared to outputs from the release psmc_check.py for DEC2109.  Only expected
     diffs in output file names were seen and temperature predictions were identical.
   * Compared model residuals for a span 2009:185 - 2010:001 and found the expected
     improvement in the reduction of underpredictions (large data - model values).
     The 1PDEAAT quantiles are below.  No change was seen in pitch, power, or SIM-Z.
